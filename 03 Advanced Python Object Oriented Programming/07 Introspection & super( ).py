# Introspection:
# Introspection in Python refers to the ability to examine an objectâ€™s attributes and methods at runtime.

    def __init__(self, email):

    def attack(self):
        print('do nothing')  # Placeholder method

# The super() function:
# `super()` allows a child class to inherit methods and properties from its parent class.
# It is used to call the constructor or other methods from the parent class, avoiding redundant code.

    def __init__(self, name, power, email):
